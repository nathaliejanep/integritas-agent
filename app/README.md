# Integritas Agent

## What is the Integritas Agent?

The **Integritas Agent** is an AI-powered assistant that helps you interact with blockchain technology for data integrity and timestamping. It's designed to make blockchain operations simple and accessible through natural conversation.

## What Can This Agent Do?

### üîê Hash Stamping

**Stamps your data hashes on the blockchain for permanent proof of existence**

- Upload any hash value and get it permanently recorded on the Minima blockchain
- Receive a unique UID (Unique Identifier) for tracking your stamped data
- Automatic monitoring until your data is confirmed on the blockchain

**Example:**

```
You: "Please stamp this hash: a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
Agent: "‚úÖ Hash stamped successfully! UID: abc123def456..."
```

### üîç Proof Verification

**Verifies that your data exists on the blockchain and hasn't been tampered with**

- Verify blockchain proofs with full NFT traceability
- Get detailed verification reports with timestamps and block information
- Confirm data integrity and authenticity

**Example:**

```
You: "Verify this proof: {"data":"...","root":"...","address":"...","proof":"..."}"
Agent: "Proof Verified! Your data was stamped on 2024-01-15..."
```

### AI-Powered Intelligence

**Uses advanced AI to understand your requests and provide helpful explanations**

- Automatically recognizes what you want to do
- Provides clear, professional explanations of blockchain concepts
- Answers questions about hash stamping and data integrity
- Formats responses in an easy-to-understand way

## How to Use the Agent
